1; // .env Storing sensitive information

2; // dependency => we need in production
// devdependency => in development and testing

3; //  Moment.js is js library commonly used for handling date and time manipulation in JavaScript. It provides functionalities such as parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates and times.

4; // Static vs Dynamic Typing
// Static vs. Dynamic defines how a language expects you to declare data types. Static typed languages require explicit definition of a data type when they create a piece of data (e.g. variable, parameter, return value). Dynamic languages are the opposite and can infer, or at least try to guess, the type that we're using.

5; // .env  file is commonly used to store environment variables in a project. These variables typically contain sensitive information or configuration settings that may vary between different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

6; // Git comments =
// git add .
// git commit -m "comment"
// git push origin or master

// git status
// git reset --hard => (discards last changes)
// git log --oneline => shows git commits

7; // mvm- minimum final product ( minimum features necessary to satisfy)

7; // mongoose is a package for using MongoDB in Node.js applications. It provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model

8; // file path directory

// One-Dot- current path from "./types/common";

// Two-Dot- parent path from "../types/common";

// Three-Dot- parent-parent path from "../../types/common";

9; // static method
// Class ning static methodida instance yarata olmaymiz

10; // Chained Query in Mongoose
// adding additional queries for queries (query sorab unga yana shart yozolimiz, masalan shu shu userlarni top va yoshi shu bo  bolsin va hkz)

HTTP Requests: On the internet, your web browser sends requests to servers when you visit websites. These requests ask for specific information, like a webpage or data.

Why Express: Express is a toolbox for building web applications in JavaScript. It provides tools and rules to handle requests and send responses. Express makes managing interactions, like viewing webpages or using app features, easier.

Creating an Express App: Writing const app = express(); means "Let's create a web app using Express." Think of app as our workspace for building the website or app.

HTTP Methods: These are actions for requests. For instance, GET gets information from a server, while POST adds data to a server.

Routing: In Express, we use routes to direct requests to different parts of our app. If someone asks for /about, we show them info about our website using routes.

Middleware: Middleware acts like a filter for requests, performing actions before they reach their final destination. It's useful for tasks like checking if a user is logged in or logging request info.

Lesson 40 - Loyihamizning standartlarini quramiz
 
Darsimiz rejasi:
- Loyihamizning standartlarini quramiz
- API requestlari haqida gaplashamiz


PROJECT STANDARDS
-Login Standards (Morgan P)
-Naming Standards
    function, method, variables =>  Camel case  
    class => Pascal
    folder file => kebab
    css => snake
-Error handling 


Notes
- Browser only accepts get, not update or delete methods. 
- get only used for providing pages, while post is used for creating or updating data.
- We mostly use get and post from postman:  
    -get(requesting data from database), 
    -post(creating, delete). This is most common case in many companies.
